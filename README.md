# Spark_ML_Classification_of_texts

text classification model that can predict what is the subject of a conversation with Spark using pyspark.ml

I use a public dataset containing conversations that took place in Usenet newsgroups.

The dataset documentation is given here http://ana.cachopo.org/datasets-for-single-label-text-categorization. 
Each of the 18821 messages belongs to a newsgroup, among 20 possible.Each newsgroup talks about a different subject
there are light topics like cars, baseball, or hockey, or a lot more serious, like the Middle East, religion or Windows.
